# Hello!
## You can see now my first step in PHP language. These scripts aren't brilliant, but I am learning a lot of new things about programming, web-development and information technology. 
### This repository has a many PHP files. I was learning about communication client-server and databases. These scripts can log user into application, get some data from server and DB, and also display data for user. I didn't use JS fetch API, so it is very unclean code.
